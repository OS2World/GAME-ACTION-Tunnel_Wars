I.  General

       TunnelWars is a OS/2 side scrolling, shoot-em-up action game. 
    This version is a DEMO (the game was written in 1994-95, but never 
    completed.  I’ve recently released all of the OS/2 shareware, including
    this one.  I’ve fixed some problems, but do not consider the game 
    complete.)  This demo show’s how OS/2 can be used to massively thread
    a game, and shows the performance OS/2 can give for an action game. 
    Please check out http://www.ratajik.net/TunnelWars for more information,
    and the source code. 
     
II. How to play


A. Starting.
	
	  Select the "Options" menu and click start.  

B.  Controlling the ship.

	  The ship can be controlled be a joystick or keyboard.  
	If using the keyboard, the following keys are used:

	Left, Right, Up, Down 	- Arrow Keys
	1-9			            - Speed	
	a	            		- Plasma Cannon
   	s	            		- Dumb Missile
	d           			- Smart Missile		
	f		            	- Raptor Missile
	g		            	- Nova Bomb
	h	            		- Plasma Carpet Bomb
	space	           		- FIRE


C.  Gameplay

	  Your goal is to destroy as many of the Walkers as you can.  
	The Walkers will in turn try to frag you (Yeah, I know, what a 
	simple game!  Sorry, it really was just meant as a OS/2 game demo.  
	While the code is in place to make it a bit more interesting, 
	I currently don’t have time to do so… and I wouldn’t do it in OS/2 if 
	I did have the time! <VGB>)

          
IV. Other shareware/PD programs to look for:

     o NetChat - This program allows many users to have Chat
                 sessions over the LAN.  It allows each user to set
                 up Conference groups and security levels.  Each
                 Conference can have as many users as you want
                 Chatting.  This is similar to CompuServer's CB, or
                 a BBS's multi-node chat area.  (This program is free
                 when you use QuikWare to register EasyPlay

     o NetMail - Improved net massaging (i.e. "Blue Boxes")

                    This program gives you better control of
               system level LAN messages.  You can enter message
               subjects, set priority levels, and type in longer
               messages. 
                    NetMail allows each user to set up their own
               message groups, along with global message groups. 
               Each user can choose which groups to receive
               messages from, and what groups to send messages to.
                    NetMail also let's you choose whether to get
               the message in the traditional VIO BlueBox (but
               better looking!), a PM Message Box, or to display
               no message but to retrieve it at a latter time.
                    This program makes Net Massaging easier to
               use, and less annoying to the recipients.

     o    DeleteDir - A simple full-screen program to delete a
          directory and all files/directories that are children to
          it.

     o    Netblast - send a LAN message.. plus be able to change the 
          FROM ID in the message (fake out LAN messaging! COOL!)

     o    ChkPath - Will check the path's you set in your
          config.sys, and let you know if you've got problems.

     o    Pwh - Path'ed Where.  Will search a path for a file.  PWH
          will tell you every place it hit's the file.  Very useful
          for checking what version of a program you using.
     
     o    MDD - Multiple make directory.  MDD will create a
          multiple directories (i.e. if you wanted to make
          C:\GREG\PROGRAM\SOURCE20\MDD\RELEASE, MDD could do it in
          one shot.)
     
     o    WHO - Will display information about all users of a
          LAN/Domain.

     o    QWHO - Displays all user ID's currently on a LAN/Domain.

     o    Vtree - Visual directory tree.
     o    EDCNFG - PM based program that will verify everything's
          okay in your config.sys, keep track/retro changes into
          multiple config's, and edit/setup a config.sys

     o    HPMLib - Library tracking system

     o    HPMCook - Cooking software

     o    HPMDiet - Dieting software

     o    JOGGER - OS/2 Program for runners.

     o    DosText - Change the message a OS/2 program gives when
          running it from DOS.

     Programming Utilities:

     o    AniButtn - Two-state animated pushbuttons that you can
          easily replace any pushbutton with.

     o    VidButtn -  Just like AniButtn, but will full-frame
          animation.  (The ones in EasyPlay work exactly like a
          pushbutton, but have up to 17 frames of animation!)
